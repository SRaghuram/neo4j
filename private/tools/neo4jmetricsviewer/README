A simple tool to display Neo4J metrics in csv format using grafana in docker.
First version is not very fault tolerant and lack error messages

Usage:
1. (Only first time) run install.sh to build the docker image (inside packaging folder)
2. (Only first time, optional) Move the docker image and run.sh to any convenient location
3. Move any metric files(csv) to a 'metrics' folder beside the docker image and the run.sh
4. (Optional) If you have many/big metric files, remove any you are not interested in, to improve performance
5. Run run.sh and visit http://localhost:3000/ in any browser
6. Locate the 'Neo4J metrics' dashboard in grafana and view the metrics


Technical setup:
1. Docker image will start latest grafana and install necessary dependencies
2. All csv files inside 'metrics' folder will be copied inside the container
3. builddashboards.js will create one grafana panel (all are currently the same) per metric file
4. CSVServer.js will serve grafana with the metrics, converting csv to json (may be slow/memory heavy with many big metric files)
