     * Calculates Unique Subgroup Thread ID: an ID that can be used to uniquely identify the current thread within the

     * <p>
     * There is one @Group per workload execution.
     * Within every group are 'subgroups', defined by the @Benchmark methods in that @Group.
     * Each @Group (workload) is assigned some number of threads, e.g., by BenchmarkRunner.
     * The threads of a @Group are assigned to subgroups according to @GroupThreads, which specifies the thread
     * count ratio between subgroups.
     * <p>
     * Every workload has N @Group instances, where N is dependent on thread count.
     * Number of threads assigned to each @Group instance is equal to the sum of @GroupThreads values of its subgroups.
     * <p>
     * In more detail:
     * <p>
     * Assume, Thread Count: 12
     * <p>
     * For, @Group: GROUP_NAME
     * <p>
     * Group Instance Count (N):
     * ==> Group Instance Thread Count = 6 (1 x createDeleteLabel, 5 x readNodesWithLabel)
     * <p>
     * ==> Group Instance Count = Total Thread Count / Group Instance Thread Count
     * <p>
     * ==> 12 / 6 --> 2
     * <p>
     * Group ID: ID of a Group Instance within all group instances, in this case [0..1]
     * <p>
     * Subgroup: @Benchmark methods in a @Group, e.g., createDeleteLabel & readNodesWithLabel
     * <p>
     * Subgroup Count: Number of @Benchmark methods per @Group, e.g., 2
     * <p>
     * Subgroup Threads: Defined by @GroupThreads, e.g., createDeleteLabel = 1, readNodesWithLabel = 5
     * <p>
     * We want to know the number of threads across all instances of a given subgroup, e.g., readNodesWithLabel.
     * <p>
     * Total Subgroup Thread Count = Subgroup Threads * Group Instances (N)
     * <p>
     * ==> createDeleteLabel = 1 * 2 (N) --> 2
     * <p>
     * ==> readNodesWithLabel = 5 * 2 (N) --> 10
     * <p>
     * Finally, for a given thread, we want to know its unique thread ID from across all Instances of a given subgroup.
     * <p>
     * Useful, e.g., to ensure that only one createDeleteLabel thread modifies any node at one time (avoids deadlocks).
     * <p>
     * As there may be many (Subgroup Count x Group Instance Count) subgroup instances,
     * Subgroup Thread ID is not be unique.
     * <p>
     * ==> Unique Subgroup Thread ID = Subgroup Thread ID + (Group ID * Subgroup Threads)
     * E.g.,
     * <p>
     * * createDeleteLabel (Subgroup Thread ID = 0 [0], Group ID = 0 [0..1])
     * ==> 0 + (0 * 1) --> 0
     * <p>
     * * createDeleteLabel (Subgroup Thread ID = 0 [0], Group ID = 1 [0..1])
     * ==> 0 + (1 * 1) --> 1
     * <p>
     * * readNodesWithLabel (Subgroup Thread ID = 3 [0..4], Group ID = 0 [0..1])
     * ==> 3 + (0 * 5) --> 3
     * <p>
     * * readNodesWithLabel (Subgroup Thread ID = 0 [0..4], Group ID = 1 [0..1])
     * ==> 0 + (1 * 5) --> 5
