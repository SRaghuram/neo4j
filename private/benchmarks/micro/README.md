Available Commands
--------------
Make sure that you have build with the flag `-PfullBenchmarks`

        $ java -jar target/micro-benchmarks.jar help
        usage: bench <command> [<args>]
        
        The most commonly used bench commands are:
            config       Creates benchmark configuration file
            help         Display help information
            ls           prints available groups and their benchmarks
            run          runs benchmarks
            run-export   runs benchmarks and exports results as JSON


Running Locally
--------------

From IntelliJ, you can add a main method to any class you want to run locally.

In a scala class named `SuperBenchmark` add:

```
object SuperBenchmark {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        Main.run(classOf[SuperBenchmark], args: _*)
    }    
}
```

In a Java class named `SuperBenchmark` add:

```
public static void main( String... args )
{
    Main.run( SuperBenchmark.class, args );
}
```

If you get the error `UnsupportedClassVersionError: ..._executePlan_jmhTest has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0`
then you probably have to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable inside IntelliJ
to the correct Java 11 JDK because it might not pick up changes from `.bashrc` or some other shell initialization file.

Custom Benchmark Execution
--------------
A specific set of benchmarks are run by default. 
For more control, it is possible to override the default mode by providing a benchmark configuration file.

        $ java -jar target/micro-benchmarks.jar help config
        NAME
                bench config - Creates benchmark configuration file
        
        SYNOPSIS
                bench config
                bench config benchmarks [(-w | --with-disabled)]
                        --path <Configuration Path> [(-v | --verbose)]
                bench config default [(-w | --with-disabled)]
                        --path <Configuration Path> [(-v | --verbose)]
                bench config groups [(-w | --with-disabled)] --path <Configuration Path>
                        [(-v | --verbose)]
        
        COMMANDS
                With no arguments, creates a benchmark configuration file limited to
                specified groups
        
                default
                    creates a benchmark configuration file limited to specified groups
        
                    With --with-disabled option, Write disabled benchmarks, in addition
                    to the enabled
        
                    With --path option, Path to export the generated benchmark
                    configuration file to
        
                    With --verbose option, Write benchmark parameters to config file, in
                    addition to enable/disable info
        
                groups
                    creates a benchmark configuration file limited to specified groups
        
                    With --with-disabled option, Write disabled benchmarks, in addition
                    to the enabled
        
                    With --path option, Path to export the generated benchmark
                    configuration file to
        
                    With --verbose option, Write benchmark parameters to config file, in
                    addition to enable/disable info
        
                benchmarks
                    creates a benchmark configuration file limited to specified
                    benchmarks
        
                    With --with-disabled option, Write disabled benchmarks, in addition
                    to the enabled

                    With --verbose option, Write benchmark parameters to config file, in
                    addition to enable/disable info


Once you have created a configuration file you can modify it:

        java -jar target/micro-benchmarks.jar config default  \
            --path path/to/exported/default.conf

You now have a configuration file (`path/to/exported/default.conf`), populated with default settings. 
Take a look inside and customize.

You can also enable just the benchmarks from specific groups (e.g., Core API, Cypher, Page 
Cache):

        java -jar target/micro-benchmarks.jar config groups  \
            --path path/to/exported/default.conf  \
            'Core API' \
            Cypher

Likewise, you can enable just specific benchmarks:

        java -jar target/micro-benchmarks.jar config benchmarks  \
            --path path/to/exported/default.conf  \
            com.neo4j.bench.micro.benchmarks.core.ReadById \
            com.neo4j.bench.micro.benchmarks.core.ReadAll

Working on the Benchmark GUI - 'Alacrity'
--------------

The user interface for the benchmarks exists in a separate repository independent of Neo4j version:

* Git repo and README: https://github.com/neo-technology/alacrity
* Live website: http://alacrity.neohq.net

If you would like to enhance the Alacrity GUI refer to the instructions on the [README](https://github.com/neo-technology/alacrity/blob/master/README.md) for checkout and deploying Alacrity.
