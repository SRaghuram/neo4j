/**
 * Panic the Database Management System (DBMS). A panic indicates that we have encountered an error that we do not expect the Database Management System to be
 * able to recover from. How the neo4j process reacts to a DBMS panic depends on the configuration set by the user.
 * <p>
 * Important: For the purposes of panics the DBMS and individual databases are considered to be loosely coupled. This means that a DBMS panic does not cause a
 * panic of any databases. And vice-versa a database panic does not cause a DBMS panic, with the single exception that a system db panic will cause a DBMS panic
 * because the system db is an essential part of the DBMS.
