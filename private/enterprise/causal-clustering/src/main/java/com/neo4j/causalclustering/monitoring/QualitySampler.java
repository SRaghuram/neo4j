/**
 * A helper class for sampling a value and associating a trustworthy timestamp with it.
 * <p>
 * Samples which are not within the time tolerance will be discarded and re-sampling
 * attempted up to the maximum number configured. The typical thing that this sampler
 * tries to protect against is skew between the sampled value and the timestamp, due
 * to for example untimely preemption or garbage collections.
