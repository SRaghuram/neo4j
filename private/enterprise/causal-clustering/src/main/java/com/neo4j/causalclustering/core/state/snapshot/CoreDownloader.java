     * Tries to catchup this instance by downloading a snapshot. A complete snapshot conceptually consists
     * of both the comparatively small state of the cluster state machines as well as the database store.
     * <p>
     * The stores are caught up using two different approaches. If it is possible to catchup by
     * pulling transactions, then this will be sufficient, but if the store is lagging too far behind then
     * a complete store copy will be attempted.
     * <p>
     * The core snapshot must be copied before the stores, because the stores have a dependency on
     * the state of the state machines. The stores will thus be at or ahead of the state machines,
     * in consensus log index, and application of commands will bring them in sync. Any such commands
     * that carry transactions will thus be ignored by the transaction/token state machines, since they
     * are ahead, and the correct decisions for their applicability have already been taken as encapsulated
     * in the copied stores.
     *
     * @param addressProvider Provider of addresses to catchup from.
     * @return the small snapshot if everything went fine and stores could be brought up to sync, otherwise an empty optional.
     * @throws IOException An issue with I/O.
     * @throws DatabaseShutdownException The database is shutting down.
